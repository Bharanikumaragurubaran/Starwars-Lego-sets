# Starwars-Lego-sets
This is based on a particular Datacamp project "Exploring the History of Lego". Where we analyse all the Lego Sets that have been released from 1999-2017.
## Datasets used
  1. lego_sets
  2. parent_themes
## Process
1. Here the dataset was already almost neat and perfect, it only had some NAN values which I removed as part of <b>Data cleaning</b><br>
2. Main focus here is <b>Starwars</b> releases.<br>
3. In the ipynb file I tried to find, <br>
    * The percentage of Star wars themed releases among all licensed themes.<br>
    * Year when a different theme beats Star wars theme over it's releases.<br>
    * I visualised top 3 themes of year 2017 and Total number of starwars releases (by year) as bar graphs in the notebook file.<br>
